A transformer is a deep learning architecture developed by Google and based on the multi-head attention mechanism, proposed in a 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need".[1] It has no recurrent units, and thus requires less training time than previous recurrent neural architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM),[2] and its later variation has been prevalently adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets, such as the Wikipedia corpus and Common Crawl.[3] Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via looking up from a word embedding table.[1] At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished. The transformer paper, published in 2017, is based on the softmax-based attention mechanism proposed by Bahdanau et. al. in 2014 for machine translation,[4][5] and the Fast Weight Controller, similar to a transformer, proposed in 1992.[6][7][8]

This architecture is now used not only in natural language processing and computer vision,[9] but also in audio[10] and multi-modal processing. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs)[11] and BERT[12] (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
